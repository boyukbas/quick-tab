Quick Tab is designed for quickly navigating to a web page where only some ID number is changing in the URL.

Quick Tab allows you to save template URLs and customize them with a "key" value entered on the popup page.
Simply add a template URL from extension options page and include "$0" where the "key" value should be inserted.

The extension will then replace "$0" with your input and open a new Tab.
